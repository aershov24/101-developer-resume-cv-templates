# Developer Resume Writing: The Complete Guide
 
Ok, let's talk about your developer resume. But that time let's talk it seriously though. And before we start I want you to ask yourself "7 Resume Quality Questions":

> 1. When was the last time you did update your resume?
> 2. Is it just one (1) sheet long?
> 3. How many keywords in your Skill Cloud (what)?
> 4. What is your resume response rate (RRR)?
> 5. Do you know your personal ROI for the last position and the time to ROI if it's positive (wtf)?
> 6. Have you ever A/B tested your resume?
> 7. Are you confident you could find a new job in two weeks starting **now**?
> 8. Can you pass your Tech & Coding interview? Not sure? Then check 3778 Tech, Coding & System Design Interview Questions here  [FullStack.Cafe - Kill Your Tech & Coding Interview](https://www.fullstack.cafe/?utm_source=fsr&utm_medium=blog)

Surprised by the questions and wondering why the heck does it all matter? Read through.

## Your Resume Sucks, Face it
We are devs, not marketers. We good at writing code and hate to sell or market any stuff even it's our own skills. This is why our resumes are so freaking bad when it comes to job hunting. We keep it growing to 4-6 pages during our career bragging about all dusted MS SQL 2005 and genuinely don't understands why that HR agent didn't call back. We keep writing about how we enjoy playing the bass guitar in our spare time. We still hope the list of Udemy courses we bought last Black Friday (and never watched) is vital to stand us out from the crowd. Wrong. Time to face it. Your resume perception is broken and you've never done it right. Here is why.

## Resume Is Your Landing Page and Nothing Else
If you're an avid internet user you're probably aware of what a landing page is. 

> A landing page is created specifically for the purposes of a **marketing** or **advertising** campaign. Landing pages are designed with a single focused objective â€“ convert a visitor to a lead by following the Call to Action (CTA).

Now behold the most esoteric job-hunting secret:
* Your resume is your **landing page**
* Recruiters are your **visitors**
* The main **goal** of your resume is to convert recruiter to **a recruiter who invites you on interview**, ideally in 2 minutes after your resume first check
* Your resume CTA (Call To Action) is a **"Contact me"** section
* The one single focused objective of your resume is to **get you a job interview** and nothing f*cking else.

Now while we keep in mind let's optimize your resume for conversion and improve your resume response rate (RRR) once and for all for **90%**.

## The Ultimate Developer Resume Checklist
Be aware, when you'll implement all the tips from the list below your phone will blow up from the headhunter calls. Stop reading if you want to keep your career in the same quiet pond as before.

### 1. Keep it short. Make it just two pages long
Yes, just one sheet of paper. The average senior dev resume is four (4) pages long. It's a huge no-no. Attract immediate attention by staying succinct and respectful to others people's time right from the start of your professional relationships. Indulge peoples ADHD. And yes, one sheet resume is amazingly convenient to navigate through on a real interview. 

> ðŸ¤œ **Best practice**:  *Shorter resumes always come to the top of the pile. Boom!*

#### How to write a powerful developer resume summary?
When describing the summary of your developer career remember about KISS principle and use that simple yet powerful template:

> `[Your professional identity]`
  with `[how many years in the profession]`
  of *broad experience* in `[Areas of expertise]`
  with a willingness to learn and master/practice `[Areas of Interest]`.
`[Strongest area of expertise]` specialist/practitioner/expert/adept.

For example:

> * Skilled Sr. Android Developer with 7+ years of broad experience in Mobile Development, Core Java & Kotlin areas with a willingness to learn and master Front-end Development and DevOps. App Store SEO specialist.

> * Inventive Front End Developer with 3+ years of comprehensive expertise in UI/UX & Design, JavaScript/ES6/ES2017 areas with a willingness to learn and master Back-end Development and Web Servers Administration. Testing, DDD/TDD expert.

> * Creative Node.js Developer with 12+ years of wide knowledge of Operating Systems & Terminal, Machine Learning areas with a willingness to learn and master Scrum & Agile and RDBMS & SQL. Blockchain expert.

The list of professional qualities for your identity:
> * innovative
* creative
* inventive
* inspired
* skilled
* proficient
* skillful
* adaptable
* ambitious
* candid
* confident
* cooperative
* devoted
* enthusiastic
* flexible
* focused
* goal Oriented
* imaginative
* independent
* insightful
* knowledgeable
* open Minded
* proactive
* responsible
* results-driven
* results-oriented
* self-reliant
* versatile'

Use that list of `areas of expertise, check what areas are important for recruiters from the job description, and use them:

> * Front-end Development
* Back-end Development
* UI/UX & Design
* JavaScript/ES6/ES2017
* Progressive Web Apps
* Single Page Apps
* SEO
* Web Components
* Infrastructure as a Service
* DevOps & CI/CD
* Multithreading Development
* Microservices & Containerisation
* Blockchain
* Testing, DDD/TDD
* Software Architecture
* RESTful & APIs
* GOF Design Patterns & OOP
* GraphQL
* Machine Learning
* Scrum & Agile
* Web Servers Administration
* Operating Systems & Terminal
* NoSQL
* RDBMS & SQL
* Graph Databases
* Knowledge Management

Use that handy synonyms for `broad experience` term:
> * strong experience
* extensive knowledge
* wide knowledge
* broad expertise
* extensive expertise
* hands-on experience
* first-hand expertise
* comprehensive experience
* professional experience'
* practical experience

### 2. Pump up your Skills Cloud section
The Skill Cloud is a list of tech stacks, languages, tools, frameworks, libs and other concepts you are familiar with. It's your only tool of the great office war so keep it sharp, clean and polished as a spartan's short sword. Use clear-cut, extensive tech terms instead of common phrases. For example, instead of *JavaScript* specify the JS specifications you're familiar with like *ES5, ES6, ES2017*. Instead of *C#* state *C# (4.0-7.3)* (if you started your career in 2010 from .NET Framework 4) and so on. Get rid of a graveyard of outdated and obsolete skills/tools/frameworks.

> ðŸ¤œ **Best practice**: *Treat your Skills Cloud like keywords in SEO. Show the HR filter systems and picky recruiters what they want - the bleeding edge techy terms they have no idea about. Boom!*

Use that list of technologies for your skills cloud:

### 3. Stop **DO**ing, start **ACHIEVE**ing
When describing your experience write down **how did you improve the business of the company and how did you achieved that** rather than listing what you was getting the pay check for. For example:

> Configuration of more than 50 win services/web portals/APIs DEV/UAT/Production CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. 95% grow of error-free dev-to-prod code delivery. Complete elimination of manual deployment practice. As a result ~210 dev hours been saved for the last year.

Always try to use numbers in your experience for better conversion:

> ðŸ¤œ **Best practice**: *To blow agent's mind you have to mention your personal ROI (return of investment) and "time to ROI" on your previous position. For example, if your salary was 5$k/m, you completed a project in 3 months and brought back to the company 60$k than your ROI is 45/15**100 = 300% and "time to ROI" is 3 months. It's essentially just one thing any company wants to know about you - how good you as an investment. Boom!*

### 4. Spice it up with **WOW** effects
That is the hardest part but if you'll master it - your career is settled. The idea of **WOW effect** is to rephrase your experience to **directly tie-up the company's business success with your technical competence** and attract even more attention from a hiring person. For example, instead of writing:
> *"Designed and implemented 2 Single Page Applications (SPA) as a part of Realine project"* -> **meh... soo boring...**

put it like 

> *"Helping Realine Project to launch 2 SPA apps (MEAR Stack, 500 reqs/sec) that increased user's engagement by 35%".* -> **WOW! That guy is awesome!**

Do you feel the flavor of competence, proficiency, and business acumen in the second sentence? Yeah, the employer will spot it too and wouldn't let it go.

> ðŸ¤œ **Best practice**: *Link your company's business success with your technical and professional competence*.

#### How to describe your development experience in the resume with WOW effect?
Remember when writing about your experience we want to give recruiter just two things they need to know about you in order to create the right WOW effect that will stand your out from the pile of mediocre resumes? So we need:

1. describe how did we change the business of the company using our technical skills and expertise

2. and what did we achieve (not did) there

For that use the following formula (including some variations):

> `Your responsibilities in action` working on a `system type/project` resulting in `quantifiable improvement for the business = WOW effect` using the set of `relevant list of technologies from your skills cloud`.

For example:

1. Documenting solution architecture for the high-volume customer-facing portal reducing the TTM (time-to-market) by 50% ensuring high code maintainability 

2. Assessing project requirements using Agile & Scrum principles related to the high-volume customer-facing portal that helped prioritize developing activities and reduce ad hoc work requests by 27%

3. Capturing the best development practices in a way of common condign standards team of 4 developers that helped to decrease code complexity and improve maintainability of the shared libraries and components.

4. Fully automated infrastructure and environments cloud provisioning related to the critical progressive web application resulting in 4x cost reduction spent on hosting.

5. Experimenting with latest front-end technologies as a part of implementation of the high-volume external web app that helped to improve speed of web development by 30%.

6. Handling full-stack programming tasks for the development of the high-profile external web app using CRUD, SQLLite, and Yii. As a result, 6 bugs-free releases have been deployed just-in-time.

7. Performing unit & load testing for the high-profile customer-facing portal applying knowledge of RSpec eliminating system's failure rate by 79%

Use that list of `developer responsibilities`:

### 5. Your contact details is your CTA
Remember the main **goal** of your resume is to convert a recruiter to the **recruiter who calls or contacts you**? I had a guy who called me from Melbourne to Perth in 15 seconds after I clicked on the "Send Application" button on Seek.com. So your contact details have to be visible on every page and easy to navigate to. Do provide your email, phone, Github and LinkedIn. Encourage agents to call you in your email/cover letter by the phrase: **ready for an immediate chat and interview**. Don't fool yourself by empty expectations, if you're interested to the agent he/she will call you in 15 minutes max just about finishing their morning flat white.

> ðŸ¤œ **Best practice**: *Copy your contacts to "header" and "footer" to increase its visibility for HR agents. It's a common UX Design practice - when a user reaching the bottom of the page point him to the next action... Yes! To call you! Boom!*

### 6. Get rid of irrelevant details
Remember, people don't care about your personal life. They digging gold like gnomes from Moria, launching new SaaSes, organizing IPO, and cracking brains how to don't f*ck up that 5 million round A investment. Your personal life is their last priority. **They will open your personality when they start to respect you.** Until that stop polluting your resume with your hobbies.

> ðŸ¤œ **Best practice**: *Always stay professional. It will help you to pop out from a horde of Apple haters, D&D players, and GoT lovers with ease of bubble sorting.*

### 7. Don't spend time on a cover letter

You are a dev, not a journalist. That's your code that matters and you honestly have other things to focus on (like noodling with Reactive programming or Golang routines in your sandbox - yeah!). Prepare a simple version of the welcome letter with your name, when you available for an interview, and attach your resume. That's it.

Use this simple developer cover letter template I was using on Seek.com.au for years:

> Gday!
> 
> Please see my CV attached. Yes, I'm a Full Stack Dev with 12+ years of experience in IT and looking for a new team to join and utilize my .NET Core/Azure/Node.js/AngularJs/X skills. Yes, I'm available for an immediate phone call. No, relocation to East Cost is not an option. 

> P.S. I don't disclose my current salary and salary expectations but happy to discuss those topics privately. 
> 
> Cheers,
> Alex Ershov.

### 8. A/B test it, test it, test it
Stop guessing. Start learning from the market.
> A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app (or resume for us) against each other to determine which one performs better.

Use A/B testing for your resume as you would do that for your landing page.

> ðŸ¤œ **Best practice**: Prepare two versions of a resume with different layouts or skill clouds. Separate your applications in two buckets (by city, time, company sector). Calculate the RRR (resume response rate) and stick with a winner.

### 9. Don't use resume builders and complicated templates
If you can't edit it in 1 minute - don't use it. Keep your resume template close to you and ready to be refined at any time. Resume builders are fun to play with (and sell, huh) but the truth is it's your personality that matters most, not the fancy resume layout you could download from the Internet. Words are still the most important communication mechanism humans use. Don't be a fool - **keep your resume template as simple as possible**, edit it as soon as you acquire new skills and **learn how to use the power of words** rather than rely on fancy CV templates you can't edit in Word and fully control. Remember - there are no shortcuts so **leave resume builders for suckers**. 

### 10. Stay prepared for your Tech, Coding, Machine Learing & Data Science Interview
